## v1.3.2b - Sep. 04, 2020
**Changed:**
- The text string that represents the current version in the program and in the code has been replaced by a dynamic variable. This will allow that when updating the variable, it will automatically apply the effects in all the places where the version is read.
- The variable that was previously called "version" has been changed to "versionlabel", the objective is that it does not conflict with the new versions variable.

**Fixed:**
- Window title corrected.

- Fixed presentation text when program was open
